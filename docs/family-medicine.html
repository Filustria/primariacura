<li><p><strong>Provider Continuity in Family Medicine: Does It Make a Difference for Total Health Care Costs?</strong> Bivariate analyses showed that patients who were visiting the same family physician had a lower total cost for medical care. A multivariate linear regression showed that provider continuity with a family physician was one of the most important explanatory variables related to the total health care cost. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1466579/pdf/0010144.pdf" target="_blank">ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE VOL. 1, NO. 3 SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2003</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why don’t family physicians follow clinical practice guidelines for cancer screening?</strong> 4 domains in a model of the determinants of cancer screening in primary care: physician characteristics, patient characteristics, social factors and practice characteristics. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232738/pdf/cmaj_159_7_797.pdf" target="_blank">CMAJ • OCT. 6, 1998; 159 (7)</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Comparison o f Family Physicians’ and Obstetricians’ Intrapartum Management of Low-Risk Pregnancies.</strong> Olhar evidências mais novas para isso aqui - Family physicians had lower rates for induction, external and internal fetal monitoring, narcotic analgesia use, and postpartum oxytocin use. Women cared for by family physicians spent less time in the hospital, both during labor and postpartum. <a href="https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/jfp-archived-issues/1993-volume_36-37/JFP_1993-11_v37_i5_a-comparison-of-family-physicians-and-o.pdf" target="_blank">The Journal of Family Practice, Vol. 37, No. 5, 1993</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quality in general practice consultations: a qualitative study of the views of patients living in an area of high socio-economic deprivation in Scotland.</strong> Patients’ perceptions of the quality of the consultation with GPs consisted of two broad, inter-relating themes; (1) the GPs’ competence, and (2) the GPs empathy or ’ caring’. Competence was often assumed but many factors coloured this assumption, in particular whether patients had experienced (directly or indirectly with a close family member) ‘successful’ outcomes with that doctor previously or not. ‘Caring’ related to patients feeling (a) listened to by the doctor and being able to talk; (b) valued as an individual by the doctor (c) that the doctor understood ‘the bigger picture’, and (d) the doctors’ explanations were clear and understandable. Relational continuity of care (being able to see the same GP and having a good relationship), and having sufficient time in the consultation were closely linked with perceptions of consultation quality. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1857696/" target="_blank">BMC Fam Pract. 2007; 8: 22. doi: 10.1186/1471-2296-8-22</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comparison of breast cancer patient satisfaction with follow-up in primary care versus specialist care: results from a randomized controlled trial.</strong> The general practice group selected responses indicating greater satisfaction than did the hospital group on virtually every question. Furthermore, in the general practice group there was a significant increase in satisfaction over baseline; a similar significant increase in satisfaction over baseline was not found in the hospital group. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1313497/" target="_blank">Br J Gen Pract. 1999 Sep; 49(446): 705–710.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The paradox of the parts and the whole in understanding and improving general practice</strong> Quality of care measures and clinical indicators are typically criticized for the limitations of the scientific evidence on which they are based and for their strong reliance on what can be measured. This larger issue is the problem of the parts and the whole - that is, indicators of the quality of care for specific diseases may not adequately represent the quality of care for the whole person. This is a particular issue in assessing general practice, in which patients often present for care of multiple problems that span different acute and chronic illness, prevention, mental health, and family care. Illness are often non-specific and undifferentiated, and much of the quality of practice involves defining the problem to be addressed. <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1093/intqhc/14.4.267" target="_blank">Kurt Stange, International Journal for Quality in Health Care</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Specialists’ perception of referrals from general doctors and family physicians working as primary care doctors in Thailand.</strong> Referrals were judged as inappropriate more often in the GD group. For referrals to internal medicine, GDs provided more incorrect diagnoses and unreasonable referrals. For orthopaedic referrals, GDs provided more incorrect diagnoses and inadequate investigations before referral. The most common comments on inappropriate referral were non-specific diagnosis, non-comprehensive case approach, too early referral, and inadequate investigation. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233627532_Specialists&#39;_perception_of_referrals_from_general_doctors_and_family_physicians_working_as_primary_care_doctors_in_Thailand" target="_blank">Quality in primary care 14(1):41-48; February 2006</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quality of Referrals from Family Medicine to Secondary Care in a University Hospital: Communication and Continuity of Care.</strong> About 80% of the referrals were made to 6 subspecialties: gastroenterology (21.95%), cardiology (17.18%), neurology (13.87%), pulmonology (11.59%), endocrinology (8.7%) and nephrology (7.87%). Consultations were done in 87.78% of the referrals. The mean waiting time was 18.27 days. 82.23% did not record a reason for referral and 13.22% did not make the referring problem clear. About 20 percent of referrals were made too early. Feedback from a specialist was provided in only 14.08% of cases. And only 3.73% of patients were sent back to family physicians. The retrospective review suggested that 23.6% of cases could have been managed by family physicians. <a href="https://www.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/ramajournal/article/view/57463" target="_blank">Lertrattananon, D., Thamakaison, S., Tubtimtes, S., Pumkompol, T., &amp; Somsri, S. (1). Ramathibodi Medical Journal, 38(4), 274-283.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Does Family Medicine training in Thailand affect patient satisfaction with primary care doctors?</strong> The response rate was 70%. There were significant differences in mean GPAQ scores among faculty family physicians, residents and general doctors. For continuity of care, patients gave higher scores for faculty family physicians (67.87) compared to residents (64.57) and general doctors (62.51). For communication skills, patients gave the highest GPAQ scores to faculty family physicians (69.77) and family medicine residents (69.79). For enablement, faculty family physicians received the highest score (82.44)
followed by family medicine residents (80.75) and general doctors (76.29). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1852109/pdf/1471-2296-8-14.pdf" target="_blank">Darin Jaturapatporn, Alan Dellow, BMC Family Practice 2007, 8:14 doi:10.1186/1471-2296-8-14</a></p></li>
