Although the available literature reflects little agreement on how to define continuity of care, it is best defined as a hierarchy of 3 dimensions; informational, longitudinal, and interpersonal continuity. Evidence and primary care - Primary care is the subject of more charters, declarations, manifestos, and principles than any other medical discipline, except perhaps its similarly plagued cousin, public health.The force of the argument for specialisation, on pragmatic grounds alone, seems irresistible. Has “evidence-based medicine” made primary care by generalist doctors an anachronism? General-practice research is too often about administration. A creeping managerialism is destroying one of primary care’s most important distinguishing traits—namely, the flexibility, informality, and pastoral strengths that come with a degree of laxity in its organisation.

During 1999–2007, hospitalizations in Brazil for ambulatory care–sensitive chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, and asthma, fell at a rate that was statistically significant and almost twice the rate of decline in hospitalizations for all other causes. In municipalities with high Family Health Program enrollment, chronic disease hospitalization rates were 13 percent lower than in municipalities with low enrollment, when other factors were held constant.

We observed a statistically significant negative association between FHP coverage and infant mortality rate. After we controlled for potential confounders, the reduction in the infant mortality rate was 13.0%, 16.0%, and 22.0%, respectively for the 3 levels of FHP coverage.

Cad. Saúde Pública vol.29 no.7 Rio de Janeiro July 2013 Impact of primary health care on mortality from heart and cerebrovascular diseases in Brazil: a nationwide analysis of longitudinal data. FHP coverage was negatively associated with mortality rates from cerebrovascular and heart diseases (ambulatory care-sensitive conditions) in both unadjusted and adjusted models for demographic, social, and economic confounders. The FHP had no effect on the mortality rate for accidents, used as a control. The rate ratio for the effect of consolidated annual FHP coverage on cerebrovascular disease mortality and on heart disease mortality was 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.86) and 0.79 (0.75 to 0.80) respectively, reaching the value of 0.69 (0.66 to 0.73) and 0.64 (0.59 to 0.68) when the coverage was consolidated during all the previous eight years. Moreover, FHP coverage increased the number of health education activities, domiciliary visits, and medical consultations and reduced hospitalisation rates for cerebrovascular and heart disease. Several complementary analyses showed quantitatively similar results.

In the mortality rate for unattended death the reduction was even greater, reaching 60% (RR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.37-0.44) in the municipalities with the highest PSF coverage. The PSF effect on unattended deaths was slightly stronger in municipalities with a higher human development index. Rasella et al.

We find consistent effects of the program on reductions in mortality throughout the age distribution, but mainly at earlier ages. Municipalities in the poorest regions of the country benefit particularly from the program. For these regions, implementation of the program is also robustly associated with increased labor supply of adults, reduced fertility, and increased school enrollment.

The Journal of Family Practice, Vol. 37, No. 5, 1993 Quality in general practice consultations: a qualitative study of the views of patients living in an area of high socio-economic deprivation in Scotland. Patients’ perceptions of the quality of the consultation with GPs consisted of two broad, inter-relating themes; (1) the GPs’ competence, and (2) the GPs empathy or ’ caring’. Competence was often assumed but many factors coloured this assumption, in particular whether patients had experienced (directly or indirectly with a close family member) ‘successful’ outcomes with that doctor previously or not. ‘Caring’ related to patients feeling (a) listened to by the doctor and being able to talk; (b) valued as an individual by the doctor (c) that the doctor understood ‘the bigger picture’, and (d) the doctors’ explanations were clear and understandable. Relational continuity of care (being able to see the same GP and having a good relationship), and having sufficient time in the consultation were closely linked with perceptions of consultation quality.

Br J Gen Pract. 1999 Sep; 49(446): 705–710. The paradox of the parts and the whole in understanding and improving general practice Quality of care measures and clinical indicators are typically criticized for the limitations of the scientific evidence on which they are based and for their strong reliance on what can be measured. This larger issue is the problem of the parts and the whole - that is, indicators of the quality of care for specific diseases may not adequately represent the quality of care for the whole person. This is a particular issue in assessing general practice, in which patients often present for care of multiple problems that span different acute and chronic illness, prevention, mental health, and family care. Illness are often non-specific and undifferentiated, and much of the quality of practice involves defining the problem to be addressed. Kurt Stange, International Journal for Quality in Health Care Specialists’ perception of referrals from general doctors and family physicians working as primary care doctors in Thailand. Referrals were judged as inappropriate more often in the GD group. For referrals to internal medicine, GDs provided more incorrect diagnoses and unreasonable referrals. For orthopaedic referrals, GDs provided more incorrect diagnoses and inadequate investigations before referral. The most common comments on inappropriate referral were non-specific diagnosis, non-comprehensive case approach, too early referral, and inadequate investigation. Quality in primary care 14(1):41-48; February 2006 Quality of Referrals from Family Medicine to Secondary Care in a University Hospital: Communication and Continuity of Care.

Consultations were done in 87.78% of the referrals. The mean waiting time was 18.27 days. 82.23% did not record a reason for referral and 13.22% did not make the referring problem clear. About 20 percent of referrals were made too early. Feedback from a specialist was provided in only 14.08% of cases. And only 3.73% of patients were sent back to family physicians.

Hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions as an indicator of access to primary care and excess of bed supply. ACSC hospitalization, while being a negative index of primary care access, can also be a measure indicating the impact of the hospital bed supply, and it is still a valid measure of the disparity of health care, the original motivation for this topic.

Clinical governance is defined as “A framework through which NHS organisations are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services and safe-guarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish.”1 It’s often thought of in terms of the seven pillars of clinical governance—clinical effectiveness, risk management, patient experience and involvement, communication, resource effectiveness, strategic effectiveness, and learning effectiveness.

Chapter 6 proposes national minimum standards for safe havens, supported by a system of external independent audit and other requirements to give the public confidence.

The potential of “big data” for improving health is enormous but, at the same time, we face a wide range of challenges to overcome urgently. There is a lack of harmonization of data formats, processing, analysis, and data transfer, which leads to incompatibilities and lost opportunities. Legal frameworks for data sharing are evolving.

Administrative data provide researchers with relatively inexpensive access to large numbers of patients nationwide and are increasingly being used for epidemiological, effectiveness, and safety outcomes studies. Publically available databases from sources such as the NIS and CMS provide information on large proportions of medical visits in the United States, and provide a good source of “real-world” health care data for reliably reported data. However, because administrative data are primarily gathered for billing purposes rather than research purposes, there are several limitations that must be considered, including the potential for inaccuracy and bias. As for all study types, critical appraisal of administrative database studies are critical to avoid arriving at inaccurate conclusions.
